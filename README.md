### Purpose
This repo is meant to be a central place for our solutions and allow for colaboration/discussion around different apporaches to solving the same problems. Likely we will also be exposed to different tools, techniques and languages.

## Getting Started
1. Within the root directory create a folder with your name/username
2. Within your folder feel free to install any tools/initialize what ever you need (ex: npm, go mod, etc)
3. Also if you would like create a `README.md` for any specific instructions to run your code
4. Solutions should be organized in a logical was with the name and part clearly identified
   - `name/dayAndPart.js` OR
   - `name/day/part.js`
5. Feel free to commit changes to your folder as you wish.
   - because we are all working off of main you may try to push a change after main has already been updated. We are working in separate directories so there is little risk. However git will not know how to handle main changing so I suggest running (git cli told me to run)
      - `git config pull.rebase true   # rebase` 
         - This will allow you to pull changes from main and rebase your changes on top of them (this will only affect this repo)
